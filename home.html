      <p>
        Having recently been awarded my undergraduate degrees, I am currently
        seeking jobs and internships in the computer hardware space,
        particularly anything related to computer architecture and hope to
        persue a masters degree in the field within the next 2 years.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I have had an avid interest in technology and personal computing
          since I was 12 with the hope of one day playing a role in the design
          of the next generation of processors or accelerators. Open source,
          privacy and security also matter a lot to me, so to that end I have
          spent a lot of time reading up on the latest computer hardware
          developments in addition to trying out several different open source
          software for personal use.

        <h2>Curernt and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          As stated before I am currently seeking jobs and internships. Apart
          from that I am also planning on taking a RISC-V certification offered
          by the Linux Foundation. I would also like to pick up and expand on
          my 8-bit ALU assignments for the sake of getting more familiar with
          VHDL and possible other HDLs like Verilog and Chisel. Expanding
          the libraries I made for some modules for an arduino project for
          more C/C++ and embedded development practise is also on my agenda.
