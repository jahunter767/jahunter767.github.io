      <h2>8-Bit ALU Part 1</h2>
      <h3>Feb 19, 2021 - Feb 26, 2021</h3>
      <p>
        This project was actually my first assignment for the course
        Microprocessors and Computer Architecture (ELET 2570) at UWI. To put
        it briefly, we were required to design an 8-bit ALU that could perform
        the operations AND, OR, EOR, ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and COMPARE using
        a tool called Logisim. For more details on the assignment and my
        submission, see this git
        <a href="https://github.com/jahunter767/elet2570-assign1">repository
        </a>.

        This was more or less my exposure to Logisim and logic simulation
        software in general. It didn't take me long to adjust to the software
        however designing the ALU for this assignment took me just under a
        week.

      <h3>Mar 5, 2021 - Mar 12, 2021</h3>
      <p>
        This assignment built on the previous one by requiring the class to
        implement the ALU designed in Logisim in VHDL. I didn't get to get to
        explore any HDLs in the summer like I wanted as I did some additional
        courses so this assignment was a first for me as well. It took a few
        days for me to really get to know the language

      <h2>DIY Multimeter</h2>
      <h3>Mar 8, 2021 - Apr 19, 2021</h3>
      <p>
        This project was actually a lab for a course called Engineering Analysis
        and Practise (ELET 3405). We were given a schematic for a multimeter
        using an ATmega 32 or ATmega 16 at the core and tasked with implementing
        the firmware. The specific features each student had to implement were
        determined by their major. One of my majors was in Electronics hence I
        had to implement firmware to measure temperature, frequency of a square
        wave and distance in addition to the default DC voltage, capacitance and
        resistance. Unfortunately due to the course being delivered remotely,
        a lack of access to the necessary modules and the lecturer having
        external issues hindering his ability to moderate the course, the
        deadline was extended beyond the typical week long duration.

      <h2>Single GPU Passthrough</h2>
      <h3>Oct 2021</h3>
      <p>
        At this point I had been dual booting Windows and Linux for almost 3
        years and realized the only real need I had for Windows was for
        proprietary software with no FOSS equivalent offered in my distro's
        repository and for the rare occasions that I play games. Realizing
        this, the idea of switching to linux full time and using a virtual
        machine with hardware passthrough for Windows became more appealing
        versus having to maintain 2 OSes, one of which I rarely use.

        This project served as a final experiment to explore the feasibility
        of running Windows in a disposable VM versus dual booting. After
        spending a few days learning how to passthrough hardware with my
        hypervisor and actively using it for my specific use cases I found the
        advantages far outweighed the disadvantages for my specific situation
        and I have since switched to linux full time in the following month.

      <h2>Scrumble</h2>
      <h3>October 1, 2021 - December 1, 2021</h3>
      <p>
        This is a 2 player game that is modeled after Scrabble but altered to
        be more competitive and fast paced. It retained most of the mechanics
        from Scrabble except that word length and the time taken to make a play
        are used to add bonuses to a player's score instead of special tiles on
        the board and points earned shift a slider in the player's favour (to
        the detriment of the opponent) in a similar fashion to a tug-of-war
        match. Matches may also be timed for an added challenge.

      <h2>MAX-30102 and MPU-6050 Arduino Libraries</h2>
      <h3>Mar 2020 - Apr 2020</h3>
      <p>
        These libraries were developed to facilitate another project I was
        working on simultaneously intended to monitor patient's well-being.
        The patient monitoring system tracked the patient's heart rate,
        sleeping position and detect falls among other things and relay the
        data to a server. While I can't release the full code for the project
        I thought at least publish the libraries for anyone who may need them
        in the future.

        Libraries had already existed for both modules however the
        communication via i2c and the logic to interface with the modules were
        deeply coupled preventing both libraries from being used simultaneously.
        Personally, I also found the code not to be very readable so I thought
        to rewrite the libraries as opposed to modifying the existing code. It
        didn't take long to implement a functional interface (I finished both
        in about a week) and most of the time was spent researching algorithms
        to detect heartbeats from the raw IR readings from the MAX 30102
        followed by orientation and fall detection from the readings from the
        MPU-6050.
